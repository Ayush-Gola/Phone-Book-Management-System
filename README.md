## 🧠 Object-Oriented Principles in Action

| 📌 **Principle**     | 🧩 **Where it's Applied**                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation**   | `contact` class – private fields with getters/setters  |
| **Abstraction**     | `operation` class – hides internal logic from driver   |
| **Inheritance**     | Can be extended using subclasses like `RegularUser`    |
| **Modularity**      | Separated concerns using `driver`, `operation`, `contact`, and `database` classes |
